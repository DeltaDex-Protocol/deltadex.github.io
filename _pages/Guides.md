## What are options?

Options are financial derivatives that give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price and date.

## What is option contract replication?

Option contract replication is the process of delta hedging the underlying asset so that a user's portfolio matches the payoff of the selected option contract.

The process of calculating the delta of the selected option contract is entirely computed on chain and so is the process of delta hedging the underlying ERC20 token.
